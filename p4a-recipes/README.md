# p4a-recipes

Place custom python-for-android recipes here when you need to build native dependencies
or vendor modified versions of libraries. For the Universal Connectivity DApp you may
need recipes for libp2p C dependencies or native crypto libraries. Creating recipes
is advanced; refer to the python-for-android docs for guidance.
